				Due to storefront’s shifting location, the company requires a flexible exhibition system for setting up their pop up shops.
				An algorithm defined in grasshopper constructs a rectilinear space based on two inputs (height and width). The user defines these positions, as well as the door’s dimensions/position. From these series of points, a snake like form is constructed based on proportions of the space to define the paths where each object will be placed.
